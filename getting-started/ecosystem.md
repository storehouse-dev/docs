title: Ecosystem Overview
---

Storehouse is a system of interconnected systems that work together to create a
development ecosystem.  Each component is interchangeable and can even be used
independently.  All our systems are built on open source platforms and tested
for compatibility.

Each component can connect to each other using an internal API for automatic
configuration.  Everything is designed to be streamlined and implement common
best-practices automatically.  You can read more about our benefits [here]({{<
ref "benefits/_index.md" >}}).
