title: Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in Storehouse!  We build an open-source ecosystem of
interchangeable systems you can use to create a customized development
environment.

Our systems run on your own hardware or in your favorite public cloud.  Once
setup, we make it easy to update your system, secure things, and backup crucial
components.

## Our Ecosystem

If you're completely new to Storehouse, you might check out our [Ecosystem
Overview]({{< ref "docs/getting-started/ecosystem.md" >}}) which highlights our
key components and a brief overview of they connect.

We designed all our components to be compatible and interchangeable.  You can
pick the platforms you're most comfortable with or already use.

## Open Source

Our platforms are open source and free to use.  If you need support or need help
integrating things, we offer paid support plans for all our products.  With all
our subscription plans, a portion always goes to support the projects we rely
on.

If you'd like to purchase a support plan, head over to our
[portal](https://portal.storehouse.dev/start) to get started.
